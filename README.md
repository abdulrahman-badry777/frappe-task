## Project Overview

This project is built using the Frappe Framework, an open-source web application framework that leverages Python and JavaScript to create robust, scalable web applications. The Frappe Framework uses an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and is the backbone for ERPNext, a comprehensive open-source ERP system.

## Key Components

1. **Apps**: The core of any Frappe project is the "App." Each app is self-contained with its own modules, doctypes, controllers, and views.

2. **Doctypes**: These are the building blocks of the data model in Frappe. Each doctype represents a table in the database and is used to manage data entities like users, products, or transactions.

3. **Controllers**: Controllers in Frappe are written in Python and handle the business logic for the application. They define what happens when data is saved, updated, or deleted.

4. **Views**: The user interface is created using web pages that are a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Views are integrated with data from doctypes via Frappe's API, allowing dynamic interaction.

5. **User and Permission Management**: Frappe provides a robust system for managing users and permissions. This ensures that access to various parts of the application is controlled and secure.
